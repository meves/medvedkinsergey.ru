Building user interfaces is about code reuse. You are constantly creating components that are used elsewhere:
- buttons
- lists
- menu
- product cards
and so on.

The web standard provides web components for this purpose. But this technology is not fully developed. More attractive is to use ***UI Framework*** or ***UI library*** like **React**.

**React** is developed and maintained by _Facebook_, the library has proven itself well in many large projects:
- _Instagram_
- _Netflix_
- _New York Times_
- _Yahoo_
- _Whatsapp_
- _Dropbox_
and in many others.

The main benefit of **React** is performance. It is achieved through a special simplified representation of the document object model - ***virtual DOM***. It stores the current state of ***DOM*** and only draws when changes are needed.

**React** is quite flexible and provides many other features, one of the most famous is the ***create react app*** utility which builds your starter app. Additionally, ***TypeScript*** support has been added to **React**.

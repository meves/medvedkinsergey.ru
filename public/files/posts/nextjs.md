When creating _web sites targeted for commercial use_, it is important that they be analyzed by search engines like ***Google***, ***Yandex*** and others. The **Nextjs** framework was created to help developers with this. It has built-in features for the developer to implement different kinds of rendering:

- generating static pages on the server during application build
- incremental static page generation during application build
- render pages on the server during the request
- rendering additional page content on the client side

As you can see from this list, **Nextjs** covers all the basic rendering needs of modern websites and applications.
In addition, **Nextjs** offers additional features such as:
- page-based routing
- API creation
- authorization and authentication
 and much more.

The possibilities of **Nextjs** are quite extensive and are described in the framework documentation.

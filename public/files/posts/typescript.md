Writing applications in **JavaScript** is fast and convenient, but only up to a certain amount of source code. **JavaScript** is dynamic in nature and you can easily get confused by adding or removing properties to or from an object and then forget about it and search long and hard for the error that caused it.

In addition, development environments are not able to do a full analysis of dynamic code and offer you tools for autocompletion and checking the correct use of data structures.

To solve such problems, a special language has been created that is fully compatible with **JavaScript** and supplements it with static type checks and features such as:
 - _interfaces_
 - _static class fields_
 - _generics_
 and other useful features.

The ***TypeScript*** compiler performs type checks, then transforms the code written in ***TypeScript*** into **JavaScript** code of the standard that you specify in the configuration file ***tsconfig.json** *.

If you are going to be writing an application of medium size or larger, or if your application is going to live for a long time, then ***TypeScript*** is your obvious choice.

TypeScript is constantly evolving with new releases coming out. Current version **4.8**

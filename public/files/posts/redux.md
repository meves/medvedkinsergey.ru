Although ***React*** has the ability to work with the state of the application, which is called _Context_, nevertheless, for projects that have a fairly intensive communication with the server, it is more preferable to use a special _application state management system_.
The **Redux** system has proven itself well for working with ***React***. It is a state management system that supports and develops the so-called **Flux** concept - _one-way data flow_, from the data source to the UI component.
**Redux** uses a centralized store, which makes it easy to manage data synchronization. In addition, **Redux** uses _dispatchers_, _reducers_, _middleware_, _action builders_ and other constructs to implement this model.
Modern **Redux** recommends using the ***Redux toolkit***. This package makes it easy to install, configure and use **Redux** in your application, plus it comes with built-in support for ***TypeScript***.

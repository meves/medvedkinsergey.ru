If you are going to develop your applications for the web, then you will never pass by the **JavaScript** programming language. Since 2015, **JavaScript** has been given a second wind. Its standard has changed significantly, and while the engine still runs good old **JavaScript**, there are many new features for writing source code:

- modern class syntax
- arrow functions
- Promise and async/await syntax

and much more. In addition, the **JavaScript** engine has become possible to use not only in the browser, but also on the server (***Node.js***), on the desktop (***Electron***) and even in embedded systems (* **Espruino***).

Thus, nowadays **JavaScript** is a modern, universal programming language. If you're still wondering if it's worth learning, don't waste your time, thousands of people are already using **JavaScript** to solve problems.
